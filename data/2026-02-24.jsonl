Previously, PFL has been shown to be naturally resistant to backdoor attack propagation across clients. In this work, we reveal that PFL remains vulnerable to backdoor attacks through a novel frequency-domain approach. We propose DCInject, an adaptive frequency-domain backdoor attack for PFL, which removes portions of the zero-frequency (DC) component and replaces them with Gaussian-distributed samples in the frequency domain. Our attack achieves superior attack success rates while maintaining clean accuracy across four datasets (CIFAR-10/100, GTSRB, SVHN) compared to existing spatial-domain attacks, evaluated under parameter decoupling based personalization. DCInject achieves superior performance with ASRs of 96.83% (CIFAR-10), 99.38% (SVHN), and 100% (GTSRB) while maintaining clean accuracy. Under I-BAU defense, DCInject demonstrates strong persistence, retaining 90.30% ASR vs BadNet's 58.56% on VGG-16, exposing critical vulnerabilities in PFL security assumptions.

While a prevailing hypothesis posits that \"Reasoning\" or \"Chain-of-Thought\" Models possess safety advantages due to their ability to self-correct, emerging research suggests these capabilities may enable more sophisticated alignment failures. This qualitative Red-Teaming case study challenges the safety-through-reasoning premise using the Qwen 3 30B architecture. By subjecting both a standard instruction-tuned model and a reasoning-enhanced model to a \"Trojan Horse\" curriculum vitae, distinct failure modes are observed. The results suggest a complex trade-off: while the Standard Model resorted to brittle hallucinations to justify simple attacks and filtered out illogical constraints in complex scenarios, the Reasoning Model displayed a dangerous duality. It employed advanced strategic reframing to make simple attacks highly persuasive, yet exhibited \"Meta-Cognitive Leakage\" when faced with logically convoluted commands. This study highlights a failure mode where the cognitive load of processing complex adversarial instructions causes the injection logic to be unintentionally printed in the final output, rendering the attack more detectable by humans than in Standard Models."}

This paper introduces ActHook, the first watermarking method tailored for agent trajectory datasets. Inspired by hook mechanisms in software engineering, ActHook embeds hook actions that are activated by a secret input key and do not alter the original task outcome. Like software execution, LLM agents operate sequentially, allowing hook actions to be inserted at decision points without disrupting task flow. When the activation key is present, an LLM agent trained on watermarked trajectories can produce these hook actions at a significantly higher rate, enabling reliable black-box detection. Experiments on mathematical reasoning, web searching, and software engineering agents show that ActHook achieves an average detection AUC of 94.3 on Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B while incurring negligible performance degradation."}

UFO features a novel 2PC protocol that systematically combines the efficient Winograd convolution algorithm with quantization to improve inference efficiency. However, we observe that naively combining quantization and Winograd convolution faces the following challenges: 1) From the inference perspective, Winograd transformations introduce extensive additions and require frequent bit width conversions to avoid inference overflow, leading to non-negligible communication overhead; 2) From the training perspective, Winograd transformations introduce weight outliers that make quantization-aware training (QAT) difficult, resulting in inferior model accuracy. To address these challenges, we co-optimize both protocol and algorithm. 1) At the protocol level, we propose a series of graph-level optimizations for 2PC inference to minimize the communication. 2) At the algorithm level, we develop a mixed-precision QAT algorithm based on layer sensitivity to optimize model accuracy given communication constraints. To accommodate the outliers, we further introduce a 2PC-friendly bit re-weighting algorithm to increase the representation range without explicitly increasing bit widths.

We introduce PrivacyBench, a benchmarking framework that reveals striking failures in privacy technique combinations with severe deployment implications. Through systematic evaluation across ResNet18 and ViT models on medical datasets, we uncover that FL + DP combinations exhibit severe convergence failure, with accuracy dropping from 98% to 13% while compute costs and energy consumption substantially increase. In contrast, FL + SMPC maintains near-baseline performance with modest overhead. Our framework provides the first systematic platform for evaluating privacy-utility-cost trade-offs through automated YAML configuration, resource monitoring, and reproducible experimental protocols. PrivacyBench enables practitioners to identify problematic technique interactions before deployment, moving privacy-preserving computer vision from ad-hoc evaluation toward principled systems design. These findings demonstrate that privacy techniques cannot be composed arbitrarily and provide critical guidance for robust deployment in resource-constrained environments."}

We investigate routing-aware explanations for MoE graph models in malware detection using control flow graphs (CFGs). Our architecture builds diversity at two levels. At the node level, each layer computes multiple neighborhood statistics and fuses them with an MLP, guided by a degree reweighting factor rho and a pooling choice lambda in {mean, std, max}, producing distinct node representations that capture complementary structural cues in CFGs. At the readout level, six experts, each tied to a specific (rho, lambda) view, output graph-level logits that the router weights into a final prediction. Post-hoc explanations are generated with edge-level attributions per expert and aggregated using the router gates so the rationale reflects both what each expert highlights and how strongly it is selected. Evaluated against single-expert GNN baselines such as GCN, GIN, and GAT on the same CFG dataset, the proposed MoE achieves strong detection accuracy while yielding stable, faithful attributions under sparsity-based perturbations. The results indicate that making the router explicit and combining multi-statistic node encoding with expert-level diversity can improve the transparency of MoE decisions for malware analysis."}

We propose SiGRRW, a single-watermark RRW framework, which is applicable to both generative models and natural images. We introduce a novel guiding strategy to generate guiding images, serving as the guidance for embedding and recovery.

Recent studies show that they can be exploited to produce policy-violating content. Existing mitigation strategies primarily operate at the pre- or mid-generation stages through techniques such as prompt filtering and safety-aware training/fine-tuning. Prior work shows that these approaches can be bypassed and often degrade generative quality. In this work, we propose ReVision, a training-free, prompt-based, post-hoc safety framework for image-generation pipeline. ReVision acts as a last-line defense by analyzing generated images and selectively editing unsafe concepts without altering the underlying generator. It uses the Gemini-2.5-Flash model as a generic policy-violating concept detector, avoiding reliance on multiple category-specific detectors, and performs localized semantic editing to replace unsafe content. Prior post-hoc editing methods often rely on imprecise spatial localization, that undermines usability and limits deployability, particularly in multi-concept scenes. To address this limitation, ReVision introduces a VLM-assisted spatial gating mechanism that enforces instance-consistent localization, enabling precise edits while preserving scene integrity. We evaluate ReVision on a 245-image benchmark covering both single- and multi-concept scenarios. Results show that ReVision (i) improves CLIP-based alignment toward safe prompts by +$0.121$ on average; (ii) significantly improves multi-concept background fidelity (LPIPS $0.166 \\rightarrow 0.058$); (iii) achieves near-complete suppression on category-specific detectors (e.g., NudeNet $70.51 \\rightarrow 0$); and (iv) reduces policy-violating content recognizability in a human moderation study from $95.99\\%$ to $10.16\\%$."}

We study counted NFT transfers and introduce ERC-7634 as a minimal realization compatible with ERC-721. The design augments each token with a transfer counter and configurable cap L, allowing ownership to evolve under a finite transfer budget. ERC-7634 defines a minimal extension interface with three lightweight functions (transferCountOf, setTransferLimit, and transferLimitOf), two events, and native-transfer hooks, requiring fewer than 60 additional lines of Solidity while preserving full backward compatibility with existing NFT infrastructure.\n  We analyze behavioral and economic consequences of counted transfers.

At the same time, organizations cannot afford to analyze and operationalize every identified risk with equal depth using more sophisticated methods, telemetry, and real-time decision logic. We therefore propose a traceable triage pipeline that connects broad, context-sensitive screening with selective deep-dive analysis of material risks.\n  The Hagenberg Risk Management Process presented in this paper integrates three steps: (i) context-aware prioritization using multidimensional polar heatmaps to compare risks across multiple operational states, (ii) Bowtie analysis for triaged risks to structure causes, consequences, and barriers, and (iii) an automated transformation of Bowties into directed acyclic graphs as the structural basis for Bayesian networks. A distinctive feature is the explicit representation of barriers as activation nodes in the resulting graph, making control points visible and preparing for later intervention and what-if analyses.

However, existing LLM unlearning methods often force LLMs to generate random or incoherent answers due to their inability to alter the encoded knowledge precisely. To achieve effective unlearning at the knowledge level of LLMs, we propose Knowledge Unlearning by Deviating representAtion (KUDA). We first utilize causal tracing to locate specific layers for target knowledge storage. We then design a new unlearning objective that induces the model's representations to deviate from its original position in the phase of knowledge removal, thus disrupting the ability to associate with the target knowledge. To resolve the optimization conflicts between forgetting and retention, we employ a relaxation null-space projection mechanism to mitigate the disruption to the representation space of retaining knowledge. Extensive experiments on representative benchmarks, WMDP and MUSE, demonstrate that KUDA outperforms most existing baselines by effectively balancing knowledge removal and model utility retention."}

We find that some failures are not purely idiosyncratic, transferring up to 12.02% across LLM assistants, and we connect these outcomes to secure architecture by outlining an \"LLM-in-the-loop\" evaluation pipeline: policy gating, retrieval grounding, structured templates, and lightweight verification checks that, when combined, reduce failures by 80.62%."}

Existing benchmarks are limited to static datasets or simulated environments, failing to capture the security risks arising from dynamic code execution, tool interactions, and multi-turn context. To bridge this gap, we introduce CIBER, an automated benchmark that combines dynamic attack generation, isolated secure sandboxing, and state-aware evaluation to systematically assess the vulnerability of code interpreter agents against four major types of adversarial attacks: Direct/Indirect Prompt Injection, Memory Poisoning, and Prompt-based Backdoor.\n  We evaluate six foundation models across two representative code interpreter agents (OpenInterpreter and OpenCodeInterpreter), incorporating a controlled study of identical models. Our results reveal that Interpreter Architecture and Model Alignment Set the Security Baseline. Structural integration enables aligned specialized models to outperform generic SOTA models. Conversely, high intelligence paradoxically increases susceptibility to complex adversarial prompts due to stronger instruction adherence. Furthermore, we identify a \"Natural Language Disguise\" Phenomenon, where natural language functions as a significantly more effective input modality than explicit code snippets (+14.1% ASR), thereby bypassing syntax-based defenses. Finally, we expose an alarming Security Polarization, where agents exhibit robust defenses against explicit threats yet fail catastrophically against implicit semantic hazards, highlighting a fundamental blind spot in current pattern-matching protection approaches."}

A significant component of the RLWE public key and ciphertext of the form $(b,a)$ is the uniformly random polynomial $a \\in R_q$ . While essential for security, the communication overhead of transmitting $a$ from client to server, and inputting it into a hardware accelerator, can be substantial, especially for FHE accelerators aiming at high acceleration factors. A known technique in reducing this overhead generates $a$ from a small seed on the client side via a deterministic process, transmits only the seed, and generates $a$ on-the-fly within the accelerator. Challenges in the hardware implementation of an accelerator include wiring (density and power), compute area, compute power as well as flexibility in scheduling of on-the-fly generation instructions. This extended abstract proposes a concrete scheme and parameters wherein these practical challenges are addressed. We detail the benefits of our approach, which maintains the reduction in communication latency and memory footprint, while allowing parallel generation of uniformly distributed samples, relaxed wiring requirements, unrestricted randomaccess to RNS limbs, and results in an extremely low overhead on the client side (i.e. less than 3%) during the key generation process. The proposed scheme eliminates the need for thick metal layers for randomness distribution and prevents the power consumption of the PRNG subsystem from scaling prohibitively with the acceleration factor, potentially saving tens of Watts per accelerator chip in high-throughput configurations."}

We systematize these risks within a unified runtime framework, categorizing threats into data supply chain attacks (transient context injection and persistent memory poisoning) and tool supply chain attacks (discovery, implementation, and invocation). We further identify the Viral Agent Loop, in which agents act as vectors for self-propagating generative worms without exploiting code-level flaws.

A critical performance bottleneck in comparison protocols is their preprocessing phase, primarily due to the high cost of generating the necessary correlated randomness. Recent frameworks introduce a passive, non-colluding dealer to accelerate preprocessing. However, two key issues still remain. First, existing dealer-assisted approaches treat the dealer as a drop-in replacement for conventional preprocessing without redesigning the comparison protocol to optimize the online phase. Second, most protocols are specialized for particular algebraic domains, adversary models, or party configurations, lacking broad generality. In this work, we present the first dealer-assisted $n$-party LTBits (Less-Than-Bits) and MSB (Most Significant Bit) extraction protocols over both $\\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$, achieving perfect security at the protocol level.

This paper directly examines the process of predicting software vulnerabilities, specifically Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), from unstructured descriptions of attacks reported in cybersecurity news articles. We propose a semantic similarity-based approach utilizing the multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 (MPNet) sentence transformer model to generate a ranked list of the most likely CVEs corresponding to each news report. To assess the accuracy of the predicted vulnerabilities, we implement four complementary validation methods: filtering predictions based on similarity thresholds, conducting manual validation, performing semantic comparisons with the first vulnerability explicitly mentioned in each report, and comparing against all CVEs referenced within the report. Experimental results, drawn from a dataset of 100 SecurityWeek news articles, demonstrate that the model attains a precision of 81 percent when employing threshold-based filtering. Manual evaluations report that 70 percent of the predictions are relevant, while comparisons with the initially mentioned CVEs reveal agreement rates of 80 percent with the first listed vulnerability and 78 percent across all referenced CVEs. In 57 percent of the news reports analyzed, at least one predicted vulnerability precisely matched a CVE-ID mentioned in the article. These findings underscore the model's potential to facilitate automated vulnerability identification from real-world cyberattack news reports."}

To address these risks, this paper proposes a comprehensive security framework, AegisSat. It ensures the integrity and resilience of satellite platforms by (i) integrating cryptographically-based secure boot mechanisms to establish a trusted computing base; (ii) enforcing strict runtime resource isolation; (iii) employing authenticated procedures for in-orbit reconfiguration and AI model updates to prevent unauthorized modifications; and (iv) providing robust rollback capabilities to recover from boot and update failures and maintain system stability. To further support our claims, we conducted experiments demonstrating the integration of these mechanisms on contemporary SoC FPGA devices. This defense-in-depth framework is crucial for space applications, where physical access is impossible and systems must operate reliably over extended periods, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness of SoC FPGA-based satellite systems and enabling secure and resilient AI operations in orbit."}

In this work, we propose a lightweight, machine-learning-based scanner that detects malicious Pickle-based files without policy generation or code instrumentation. Our approach statically extracts structural and semantic features from Pickle bytecode and applies supervised and unsupervised models to classify files as benign or malicious. We construct and release a labeled dataset of 727 Pickle-based files from Hugging Face and evaluate our models on four datasets: our own, PickleBall (out-of-distribution), Hide-and-Seek (9 advanced evasive malicious models), and synthetic joblib files. Our method achieves 90.01% F1-score compared with 7.23%-62.75% achieved by the SOTA scanners (Modelscan, Fickling, ClamAV, VirusTotal) on our dataset. Furthermore, on the PickleBall data (OOD), it achieves 81.22% F1-score compared with 76.09% achieved by the PickleBall method, while remaining fully library-agnostic. Finally, we show that our method is the only one to correctly parse and classify 9/9 evasive Hide-and-Seek malicious models specially crafted to evade scanners. This demonstrates that data-driven detection can effectively and generically mitigate Pickle-based model file attacks."}

In this paper we investigate whether quantum methods might offer alternative approaches. The line of inquiry is inspired by Regev's relating of certain lattice problems to the hidden dihedral subgroup problem. We use neighbourhoods of binary fields to produce a function close to fulfilling Simon's promise with difference equal to the secret parity vector. Although unlikely to recover the secret parity vector directly, running Simon's algorithm essentially produces new LPN samples. This gives the hope that we might be able to produce enough new samples to ignore one or more variables and iteratively reduce the problem.\n  We make no claim that these methods will necessarily be competitive with existing approaches, merely that they warrant deeper investigation."}

By capturing volatile system state, memory analysis enables the recovery of transient artifacts such as decrypted payloads, executed commands, credentials, and cryptographic keys that are often inaccessible through static or traditional dynamic analysis. While several automated models have been proposed for malware detection from memory, their outputs typically lack interpretability, and memory analysis still relies heavily on expert-driven inspection of complex tool outputs, such as those produced by Volatility. In this paper, we propose an explainable, AI-assisted memory forensics approach that leverages general-purpose large language models (LLMs) to interpret memory analysis outputs in a human-readable form and to automatically extract meaningful Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), in some circumstances detecting more IoCs than current state-of-the-art tools. We apply the proposed methodology to both Windows and Android malware, comparing full RAM acquisition with target-process memory dumping and highlighting their complementary forensic value. Furthermore, we demonstrate how LLMs can support both expert and non-expert analysts by explaining analysis results, correlating artifacts, and justifying malware classifications. Finally, we show that a human-in-the-loop workflow, assisted by LLMs during kernel-assisted setup and analysis, improves reproducibility and reduces operational complexity, thereby reinforcing the practical applicability of AI-driven memory forensics for modern malware investigations."}

In light of these emerging and unavoidable safety challenges, we argue that such risks should be treated as expected operational conditions rather than exceptional events, necessitating a dedicated incident-response perspective. Consequently, the primary barrier to trustworthy deployment is not further improving model capability but establishing system-level threat monitoring mechanisms that can detect and contextualize security-relevant anomalies after deployment -- an aspect largely underexplored beyond testing or guardrail-based defenses. Accordingly, this position paper advocates systematic and comprehensive monitoring of security threats in LLM-enabled applications as a prerequisite for reliable operation and a foundation for dedicated incident-response frameworks."}

In response, private inference (PI) protocols have been created to allow parties to perform inference without revealing their sensitive data. Despite recent advances in the efficiency of PI, most current methods assume a semi-honest threat model where the data owner is honest and adheres to the protocol. However, in reality, data owners can have different motivations and act in unpredictable ways, making this assumption unrealistic. To demonstrate how a malicious client can compromise the semi-honest model, we first designed an inference manipulation attack against a range of state-of-the-art private inference protocols. This attack allows a malicious client to modify the model output with 3x to 8x fewer queries than current black-box attacks. Motivated by the attacks, we proposed and implemented RobPI, a robust and resilient private inference protocol that withstands malicious clients. RobPI integrates a distinctive cryptographic protocol that bolsters security by weaving encryption-compatible noise into the logits and features of private inference, thereby efficiently warding off malicious-client attacks. Our extensive experiments on various neural networks and datasets show that RobPI achieves ~91.9% attack success rate reduction and increases more than 10x the number of queries required by malicious-client attacks."}

Yet it remains unclear whether individuals can reliably distinguish AI-generated speech from human-recorded voices in realistic scam contexts and what perceptual strategies underlie their judgments. We conducted a controlled online study in which 22 participants evaluated 16 vishing-style audio clips (8 AI-generated, 8 human-recorded) and classified each as human or AI while reporting confidence. Participants performed poorly: mean accuracy was 37.5%, below chance in a binary classification task. At the stimulus level, misclassification was bidirectional: 75% of AI-generated clips were majority-labeled as human, while 62.5% of human-recorded clips were majority-labeled as AI. Signal Detection Theory analysis revealed near-zero discriminability (d' approx 0), indicating inability to reliably distinguish synthetic from human voices rather than simple response bias. Qualitative analysis of 315 coded excerpts revealed reliance on paralinguistic and emotional heuristics, including pauses, filler words, vocal variability, cadence, and emotional expressiveness. However, these surface-level cues traditionally associated with human authenticity were frequently replicated by AI-generated samples. Misclassifications were often accompanied by moderate to high confidence, suggesting perceptual miscalibration rather than uncertainty. Together, our findings demonstrate that authenticity judgments based on vocal heuristics are unreliable in contemporary vishing scenarios. We discuss implications for security interventions, user education, and AI-mediated deception mitigation."}

SkillInject contains 202 injection-task pairs with attacks ranging from obviously malicious injections to subtle, context-dependent attacks hidden in otherwise legitimate instructions. We evaluate frontier LLMs on SkillInject, measuring both security in terms of harmful instruction avoidance and utility in terms of legitimate instruction compliance. Our results show that today's agents are highly vulnerable with up to 80% attack success rate with frontier models, often executing extremely harmful instructions including data exfiltration, destructive action, and ransomware-like behavior. They furthermore suggest that this problem will not be solved through model scaling or simple input filtering, but that robust agent security will require context-aware authorization frameworks.
